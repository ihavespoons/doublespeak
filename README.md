# doublespeak
More than anything there is one thing a lot of great open-source projects lack - Great Documentation, doublespeak aims to provide a two fold approach to this: A: Provide a platform and framework for application developers to write and generate great documentation and display it, B: Provides users of open-source products with commandline, gui and web clients to allow for easy situational access to documentation.
